 Detailed Proposals
 
 1. Modularize Features
    Rationale: Large view controllers impede maintainability and testing.
    Plan:
    - Extract reusable UI components (e.g., input bar, message list, file cell) into separate views/classes.
    - Move business logic into view models.
 
 2. Adopt Protocol-Oriented Design
    Rationale: Interfaces facilitate mocking and swapping implementations during testing or upgrades.
    Plan:
    - Extract protocols for key services (e.g., `APIClientProtocol`, `WebSocketManaging`).
    - Update dependencies to accept protocol types.
 
 3. Swift Concurrency Adoption
    Rationale: Modern async/await allows safer, more readable concurrency.
    Plan:
    - Refactor async code to use Swift's concurrency primitives.
    - Use actors for shared mutable state.
 
 4. Dependency Injection
    Rationale: Promotes testability and decoupled design.
    Plan:
    - Replace singleton usage (`DIContainer.shared`) with initializer injection.
    - Use property wrappers (e.g., `@EnvironmentObject` in SwiftUI) where appropriate.
 
 5. Centralize Theme & Style
    Rationale: Consistency and ease of customization.
    Plan:
    - Move all color/font/layout constants into a single Themes module or asset catalog.
    - Replace literals with references.
 
 6. Accessibility Enhancements
    Rationale: Broader reach and compliance.
    Plan:
    - Add descriptive accessibility labels to all interactive elements and custom views.
    - Test with VoiceOver.
 
 7. Consistent Use of Accessibility Identifiers
    Rationale: Stable UI test automation.
    Plan:
    - Standardize identifier naming (e.g., `projectCell_0`, `chatSendButton`).
    - Ensure all dynamic cells/buttons are tagged.
 
 8. Dynamic Sizing & Layout
    Rationale: Proper UI scaling for all users.
    Plan:
    - Migrate all static frames to Auto Layout.
    - Adopt Dynamic Type for text sizes.
 
 9. Localization
    Rationale: Preparation for internationalization.
    Plan:
    - Move all hardcoded strings into `Localizable.strings` with context comments.
 
 10. Reduce Force Unwrapping
     Rationale: Safer runtime behavior.
     Plan:
     - Replace `!` force unwraps with optional binding or error handling.
     - Add guards where data is mandatory.
 
 11. Leverage Extensions
     Rationale: Code reuse and clarity.
     Plan:
     - Move utility functions and computed properties into type-specific extensions.
     - Group extensions by feature or type.
 
 12. Limit Use of Shared State
     Rationale: Prevent race conditions and hidden bugs.
     Plan:
     - Encapsulate `UserDefaults` access in a manager class.
     - Use in-memory or actor-based storage for transient state.
 
 13. Refactor Error Handling
     Rationale: More actionable and user-friendly errors.
     Plan:
     - Use Swiftâ€™s new error reporting APIs.
     - Provide recovery suggestions/context in user alerts.
 
 14. Batch UI Updates
     Rationale: Performance and animation smoothness.
     Plan:
     - Group related UI changes within animation or update blocks.
 
 15. Model Decoding Improvements
     Rationale: Type safety and clarity.
     Plan:
     - Use typed models rather than `[String: Any]` or `AnyCodable`.
     - Add failable model init for complex payloads.
 
 16. Centralize API Endpoints
     Rationale: Maintenance, clarity, and documentation.
     Plan:
     - Store all endpoints in a single struct/enum.
     - Add doc comments and sample requests/responses.
 
 17. Improve WebSocket Lifecycle
     Rationale: Robust realtime experience.
     Plan:
     - Refactor reconnect logic for clarity and resilience.
     - Consider async streams or Combine for events.
 
 18. Use Modern Date Handling
     Rationale: Avoid timezone bugs and inconsistencies.
     Plan:
     - Use `ISO8601DateFormatter` and explicit time zones everywhere.
 
 19. Write Unit & UI Tests
     Rationale: Protect against regressions, enable safe refactoring.
     Plan:
     - Add test targets for all logic and flows.
     - Use mocks for network and services.
 
 20. Document Public APIs
     Rationale: Easier onboarding and maintenance.
     Plan:
     - Add Swift documentation comments to all public types/methods.
 
 21. Code Documentation
     Rationale: Better comprehension for complex logic.
     Plan:
     - Add inline comments for tricky algorithms or asynchronous flows.
 
 22. Reduce Duplication
     Rationale: Maintainability and DRY principle.
     Plan:
     - Factor shared logic into helpers or base classes.
 
 23. Swift Data Usage Review
     Rationale: Data integrity and correct relationships.
     Plan:
     - Audit all data model relationships/annotations for clarity and concurrency.
 
 Implementation Workflow
 1. Prioritize proposals based on technical debt, risk, and impact.
 2. Refactor and test in small, incremental PR-style batches.
 3. Run full unit/UI/integration test suite after each batch.
 4. Document changes with migration/release notes for your team.
 
 Approval & Next Steps
 - Review this proposal and select the priorities or sequence.
 - Upon approval, a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan will be developed and executed, including code samples and migration guides as needed.
