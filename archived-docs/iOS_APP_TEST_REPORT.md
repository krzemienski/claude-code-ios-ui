# iOS Claude Code UI - Test Report
## Date: January 14, 2025
## Test Environment: iPhone 16 Pro Simulator (iOS 18.5)

## Executive Summary
The iOS app is partially functional but has critical WebSocket issues that prevent real-time chat from working. While basic navigation and data loading work, the core messaging functionality is broken.

## ‚úÖ What's Actually Working

### 1. **App Launch & Basic UI**
- App launches successfully without crashes
- Cyberpunk-themed UI displays correctly with cyan/pink color scheme
- Tab bar navigation shows Projects, Sessions, and Settings tabs
- Dark theme is properly implemented

### 2. **Projects List**
- Successfully loads and displays projects from backend
- Shows 14+ projects including:
  - nick
  - Desktop
  - Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor
  - CodeAgentsMobile
  - alm0730
  - automation-job-apply
  - job-automation-update
  - ccbios
  - ccbios-enhanced
  - streaming-response-validation
  - task-planning-workflow
  - final
  - agentrooms
  - claudecodeios

### 3. **Backend Connection**
- JWT authentication is working (fixed as claimed)
- Successfully authenticates with token
- API calls to load projects work correctly
- Backend server connection established on http://localhost:3004

### 4. **Session Navigation**
- Can tap on projects to navigate to session/chat view
- Session messages load and display (confirmed fix)
- Shows previous chat history with formatted messages
- Message UI displays correctly with user/assistant distinction

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working

### 1. **Critical WebSocket Issues**
**SEVERITY: P0 - BLOCKS CORE FUNCTIONALITY**
- WebSocket connects but immediately disconnects in an infinite loop
- Backend logs show hundreds of connect/disconnect cycles per minute
- Pattern: Connect ‚Üí Authenticate ‚Üí Connected ‚Üí Disconnect ‚Üí Repeat
- This prevents any real-time messaging from working
- Cannot send or receive new messages

### 2. **Chat Functionality**
- Text input field accepts text but cannot send messages
- Send button appears to do nothing
- No message appears in chat after attempting to send
- No error messages shown to user

### 3. **Tab Navigation Issues**
- Settings tab doesn't navigate properly
- Tapping Settings keeps showing Sessions view
- Tab bar highlights change but view doesn't update

### 4. **Empty States**
- Sessions list shows empty state with loading animation
- No actual session list displayed
- Search bar present but functionality untested

## üîç Technical Analysis

### WebSocket Connection Loop Issue
The backend logs reveal a critical problem:
```
‚úÖ WebSocket authenticated for user: demo
üí¨ Chat WebSocket connected
üîå Chat client disconnected
[Repeats infinitely]
```

This indicates the app is:
1. Successfully connecting to ws://localhost:3004/ws
2. Successfully authenticating with JWT token
3. Immediately disconnecting
4. Attempting to reconnect instantly
5. Creating an infinite loop

### Likely Root Causes:
1. **Incorrect WebSocket URL**: Documentation claims it should be `/ws` but might be trying `/api/chat/ws`
2. **Message Type Mismatch**: App might be sending wrong message format
3. **Missing Keep-Alive**: WebSocket might timeout immediately
4. **Reconnection Logic Bug**: Auto-reconnect might be too aggressive

## üìä Claimed Fixes vs Reality

| Claimed Fix | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| JWT Authentication (milliseconds to seconds) | ‚úÖ WORKING | Backend accepts token, no 403 errors |
| Session Messages Loading | ‚úÖ WORKING | Messages display in chat view |
| WebSocket URL Fixed | ‚ùå NOT WORKING | Infinite connect/disconnect loop |
| WebSocket Message Type | ‚ùå UNTESTED | Cannot send messages due to connection issue |
| Project Path Sending | ‚ùå UNTESTED | Cannot test due to WebSocket issues |

## üéØ Priority Fixes Required

### P0 - Critical (Blocks Core Functionality)
1. **Fix WebSocket Connection Loop**
   - Debug why connection drops immediately
   - Check WebSocket URL path
   - Implement proper keep-alive mechanism
   - Fix reconnection logic

2. **Enable Message Sending**
   - Fix WebSocket stability first
   - Ensure correct message format
   - Add error handling and user feedback

### P1 - High Priority
3. **Fix Tab Navigation**
   - Settings tab should show settings view
   - Ensure proper view controller presentation

4. **Implement Session List**
   - Show actual sessions instead of empty state
   - Connect to backend session endpoints

### P2 - Medium Priority
5. **Error Handling**
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Add connection status indicators
   - Implement retry mechanisms with backoff

## üì± Screenshots Evidence

1. **Projects List**: Successfully loads and displays all projects
2. **Chat View**: Shows previous messages correctly but cannot send new ones
3. **Sessions View**: Shows empty state with search bar
4. **Tab Bar**: Navigation highlights work but Settings doesn't navigate

## üî¨ Backend Server Status
- Server: ‚úÖ Running on http://localhost:3004
- HTTP API: ‚úÖ Working for projects and sessions
- WebSocket: ‚ùå Connects but immediately disconnects
- Authentication: ‚úÖ JWT tokens accepted

## Conclusion

While the app has made progress with JWT authentication and session loading fixes, the critical WebSocket issue makes the app essentially non-functional for its primary purpose - real-time chat. The infinite connection loop needs immediate attention before any other features can be properly tested or implemented.

**Current Functionality: ~30% of intended features working**
**Recommendation: Focus all efforts on fixing WebSocket connection stability**
