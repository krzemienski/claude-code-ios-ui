- Factory methods for different cell types

#### Implementation Example:
```swift
// Simple usage in any view controller
tableView.showSkeletonLoading(count: 6, cellHeight: 80)
// Later...
tableView.hideSkeletonLoading()
```

#### Key Features:
- ASCII art for each state type
- Floating animations (3D transforms)
- Action buttons with handlers
- Glow effects and neon colors
- Responsive to trait changes

#### Implementation Example:
```swift
private lazy var emptyStateView: NoDataView = {
    let view = NoDataView(type: .noSessions) { [weak self] in
        self?.createNewSession()
    }
    return view
}()
```

showNetworkError(
    message: "WebSocket connection lost",
    retryAction: { [weak self] in
        self?.webSocketManager.connect()
    }
)
```
