# Session Checkpoint - 2025-08-30 - iOS UI Context Analysis

## Session Overview
Performed comprehensive iOS project analysis as context-manager agent for ClaudeCodeUI-iOS project.

## Key Findings

### Project State
- **Build System**: Dual configuration with Tuist and SPM
- **Architecture**: MVVM with SwiftData persistence, WebSocket communication
- **Chat Feature**: Recently refactored into 9 components with ChatComponentsIntegrator
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test scenarios defined but many tests disabled

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Message Status Bug** (P0): Status stuck on 'sending', no state transitions
2. **Message Persistence** (P0): No SwiftData saving, messages lost on restart  
3. **Connection UI** (P0): WebSocket status not reflected in UI
4. **Component Integration**: Refactored components need proper coordination

### File Organization Insights
- Chat feature has been heavily refactored with new handler/manager pattern
- Multiple files disabled (.disabled extension) indicating ongoing refactoring
- Test files in flux - some deleted, some disabled
- New directories added for better organization (Scripts/, UIComponents/, docs/)

### Memory Optimization Concerns
- Message limit: 100 in memory
- Batch loading: 50 messages at a time
- SwiftDataContainer has in-memory fallback
- Performance targets: 60 FPS, <100MB memory, <3s load

## Next Steps for Other Agents

### For Development Agents
1. Review and fix the 3 P0 critical issues in ChatViewController
2. Complete ChatComponentsIntegrator initialization
3. Implement message persistence with SwiftData
4. Fix WebSocket status UI updates

### For Testing Agents  
1. Restore disabled test files
2. Implement ui-test-scenarios.json test cases
3. Achieve 90% unit test coverage target
4. Validate performance metrics

### For Architecture Agents
1. Resolve component circular dependencies
2. Optimize message memory management
3. Improve WebSocket reconnection reliability
4. Review and clean up disabled/deleted files
