**Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Server**: http://localhost:3004  
**Total Endpoints**: 62  
**Test Results**: Mixed (see details below)

## Summary

- ✅ **Working**: 13 endpoints (22%)
- ❌ **Failed**: 44 endpoints (75%)
- ⚠️ **Skipped**: 2 endpoints (3%)

## Detailed Results by Category

### 1. AUTHENTICATION (5 endpoints) - Partially Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Register | POST | /api/auth/register | ⚠️ SKIPPED | User might already exist |
| Login | POST | /api/auth/login | ⚠️ SKIPPED | Auth not fully configured |
| Status | GET | /api/auth/status | ✅ PASS | Returns auth disabled |
| User | GET | /api/auth/user | ❌ FAIL | Returns test user instead of 401 |
| Logout | POST | /api/auth/logout | ✅ PASS | Works correctly |

**Issue**: Authentication is disabled in development mode, returns mock data.

### 2. PROJECTS (5 endpoints) - Partially Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| List Projects | GET | /api/projects | ✅ PASS | Returns project list |
| Create Project | POST | /api/projects/create | ❌ FAIL | Path validation error |
| Get Project | GET | /api/projects/:name | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |
| Rename Project | PUT | /api/projects/:name/rename | ✅ PASS | Works but needs valid project |
| Delete Project | DELETE | /api/projects/:name | ❌ Not tested | Cleanup failed |

**Issue**: Project creation requires existing filesystem paths.

### 3. SESSIONS (6 endpoints) - Mostly Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| List Sessions | GET | /api/projects/:name/sessions | ✅ PASS | Returns empty array |
| Create Session | POST | /api/projects/:name/sessions | ✅ PASS | Creates session successfully |
| Get Session | GET | /api/projects/:name/sessions/:id | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |
| Get Messages | GET | /api/projects/:name/sessions/:id/messages | ✅ PASS | Returns empty array |
| Add Message | POST | /api/projects/:name/sessions/:id/messages | ❌ FAIL | Endpoint not found (404) |
| Delete Session | DELETE | /api/projects/:name/sessions/:id | ❌ FAIL | File system error |

**Issue**: Message creation endpoint appears to be missing.

### 4. FILES (4 endpoints) - Not Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Get File Tree | GET | /api/projects/:name/files | ❌ FAIL | Project path not found |
| Read File | GET | /api/projects/:name/file | ❌ FAIL | Invalid file path |
| Save File | PUT | /api/projects/:name/file | ❌ FAIL | Invalid file path |
| Delete File | DELETE | /api/projects/:name/file | ❌ FAIL | Endpoint not found (404) |

**Issue**: File operations require valid project paths on filesystem.

### 5. GIT (20 endpoints) - Not Working Correctly

All Git endpoints return 400 errors because they require:
- Valid project name parameter
- Existing Git repository
- Proper request body structure

**Common Error**: "Project name is required" - endpoints expect projectName in query params or body.

### 6. MCP SERVERS (6 endpoints) - Partially Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| List Servers | GET | /api/mcp/servers | ✅ PASS | Returns empty array |
| Add Server | POST | /api/mcp/servers | ❌ FAIL | Missing required field: type |
| Get Server | GET | /api/mcp/servers/:id | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |
| Test Connection | POST | /api/mcp/servers/:id/test | ❌ FAIL | Server not found |
| Execute CLI | POST | /api/mcp/cli | ✅ PASS | Returns success |
| Delete Server | DELETE | /api/mcp/servers/:id | ❌ FAIL | Server not found |

**Issue**: MCP server creation requires 'type' field not documented.

### 7. SEARCH (2 endpoints) - Not Working

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Project Search | POST | /api/projects/:name/search | ❌ FAIL | Project path not found |
| Suggestions | GET | /api/search/suggestions | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |

**Issue**: Search requires valid project paths.

### 8. CURSOR (8 endpoints) - Unexpectedly Working!

| Endpoint | Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Config | GET | /api/cursor/config | ✅ WORKS | Returns config (expected 404) |
| Update Config | POST | /api/cursor/config | ✅ WORKS | Updates config |
| List Sessions | GET | /api/cursor/sessions | ✅ WORKS | Returns empty array |
| Get Session | GET | /api/cursor/session/:id | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |
| Import Session | POST | /api/cursor/session/import | ✅ WORKS | Returns 404 as expected |
| Get Database | GET | /api/cursor/database | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |
| Sync | POST | /api/cursor/sync | ✅ WORKS | Returns 404 as expected |
| Get Settings | GET | /api/cursor/settings | ❌ ERROR | Redirect issue |

**Surprise**: Cursor endpoints are actually implemented, not missing as documented!

### 9. WEBSOCKETS (2 endpoints) - Working

| Endpoint | Protocol | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Chat WebSocket | WS | /ws | ✅ PASS | Connects successfully |
| Terminal WebSocket | WS | /shell | ✅ PASS | Connects successfully |

**Success**: Both WebSocket endpoints are working correctly.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Redirect Problem**: Many GET endpoints redirect to http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
2. **Path Validation**: Project and file operations require valid filesystem paths
3. **Missing Parameters**: Git endpoints need projectName in request
4. **Missing Endpoints**: Some documented endpoints return 404
5. **Auth Disabled**: Authentication is disabled in development mode

## Recommendations for iOS App

1. **Use Real Projects**: Test with actual project paths that exist on filesystem
2. **Include Project Name**: Always include projectName parameter for Git operations
3. **Handle Redirects**: Configure HTTP client to not follow redirects automatically
4. **Mock Data**: Use mock data for file operations during development
5. **WebSocket Priority**: Focus on WebSocket features as they work correctly

## Working Features for iOS

Based on the test results, these features should work in the iOS app:

✅ **Fully Working**:
- WebSocket chat communication
- WebSocket terminal communication
- Project listing
- Session creation and listing
- MCP CLI execution
- Basic Cursor configuration

⚠️ **Partially Working**:
- Authentication (disabled but returns mock data)
- Session management (create/list work, delete has issues)
- MCP server listing

❌ **Not Working Without Valid Paths**:
- File operations
- Git operations
- Search functionality
- Project creation

## Required Fixes for Full Functionality

1. **Backend Fixes Needed**:
   - Fix redirect issues for GET endpoints
   - Add missing DELETE endpoints for files
   - Add POST endpoint for session messages
   - Improve error messages for Git operations

2. **iOS App Adjustments**:
   - Use existing project paths for testing
   - Add projectName to all Git API calls
   - Handle auth disabled state gracefully
   - Focus on working features first

## Test Command

To run the verification test:

```bash
cd /Users/nick/Documents/claude-code-ios-ui/backend
node verify-all-endpoints.js
```

## Conclusion

The backend is **partially functional** with:
- 22% of endpoints fully working
- WebSockets working correctly
- Core features (projects, sessions) partially working
- Surprise discovery: Cursor integration is implemented

The iOS app should focus on the working features and handle the backend's current limitations gracefully.
