# iOS Claude Code UI - Task Consolidation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Deleted Duplicate Files
- ‚ùå **Removed**: `ios-development-tasks.md` (698 lines of granular Docker tasks)
- Reason: Contained 500+ micro-tasks that were too granular and not actionable

### 2. Consolidated CLAUDE.md
- **Before**: 917 lines with 200+ duplicate generic tasks in Sections 2-15
- **After**: 705 lines with 37 focused, actionable tasks
- **Removed**: Generic task blocks like "Task 3.1-3.25", "Task 4.1-4.30", etc.
- **Kept**: Specific, actionable tasks with clear files and endpoints

### 3. Removed Cursor References
- **Deleted**: All mentions of deprecated Cursor integration (8 endpoints)
- **Updated**: API counts to exclude Cursor (54 total endpoints instead of 62)
- **Cleaned**: Summary section to remove Cursor from missing features

### 4. Organized Tasks by Priority
- **Priority 0 (Critical)**: 6 MCP Server Management tasks
- **Priority 1 (High)**: 8 tasks (4 Search + 4 Terminal)
- **Priority 2 (Medium)**: 15 tasks (10 UI/UX + 5 Testing)
- **Priority 3 (Low)**: 3 File operation tasks
- **Priority 4 (Nice-to-have)**: 5 misc tasks

### 5. Incorporated TODO Comments
Found and included 5 TODO comments from Swift files:
- Attachment options in ChatViewController
- File Explorer navigation
- Terminal navigation
- File/folder creation
- Prefetch implementation

## üìä Results

### Task Reduction
