- Integration tests incomplete
- UI tests not comprehensive
- Performance tests missing

### Test Infrastructure
- No CI/CD pipeline configured
- Manual testing only
- No automated regression testing

## 7. PRODUCTION READINESS GAPS

### Missing for App Store
- [ ] App Store screenshots
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] Terms of service
- [ ] App icons (all sizes)
- [ ] Launch screen
- [ ] Onboarding flow incomplete

### Security Gaps

2. Security enhancements
3. Widget extension
4. Share extension

## 9. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Development Team
- iOS Developer: 1 FTE for 4-6 weeks
- Backend Developer: 0.5 FTE for 2 weeks (Cursor endpoints)
- QA Engineer: 0.5 FTE for 2 weeks
- UI/UX Designer: Consultation for empty states

### Infrastructure
- TestFlight setup for beta testing
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/Fastlane)
- Crash reporting (Firebase/Sentry)
- Analytics platform

## 10. SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Metrics
- 100% API endpoint coverage
- <2s app launch time
- <150MB memory usage
- 0 crashes per 1000 sessions

### Quality Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage
- All P0/P1 issues resolved
- Clean static analysis
- No force unwrapping

### Business Metrics
- App Store approval
- 4+ star rating
- <1% crash rate
- 80%+ feature adoption

## Conclusion

The iOS Claude Code UI app is **functionally complete** for core features but has **critical UI accessibility issues** that prevent full functionality. The 79% implementation represents solid progress, with major systems like WebSocket, Git, and file operations fully operational.

**Recommendation**: Focus immediately on P0 issues (MCP UI access) before proceeding with new features. The app is 2-3 weeks away from production readiness with focused effort on the identified gaps.
